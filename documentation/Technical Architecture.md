# AICP Budget Management System - Technical Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture decisions for the AICP Budget Management System, a SaaS application designed for line producers in the film industry to manage and track AICP budgets.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend
**Choice: React + React-Spreadsheet + React Query**
- React for component-based UI development
- React-Spreadsheet for MVP spreadsheet functionality (can upgrade to AG Grid if needed)
- React Query for state management and API integration

Rationale:
- React-Spreadsheet provides adequate functionality for MVP without licensing costs
- React Query offers robust data synchronization and caching
- Component isolation allows future UI library changes

### Backend
**Choice: Django + Django REST Framework**
- Django for robust ORM and admin interface
- DRF for RESTful API development
- Celery for background tasks
- Redis for caching and task queue

Rationale:
- Strong ORM for complex budget relationships
- Built-in admin interface saves development time
- Excellent authentication and permissions system
- Django Signals for audit logging

### Database
**Choice: PostgreSQL**
- JSONB columns for flexible budget data
- Row-level locking for concurrency control
- Robust indexing for performance

Rationale:
- ACID compliance crucial for financial data
- Excellent support for JSON operations
- Built-in audit logging capabilities

### Integration Layer
**Choice: Make.com (iPaaS)**
- Handles ClickUp integration
- Manages Google Sheets synchronization
- Provides webhook endpoints

Rationale:
- Reduces custom integration code
- Easier maintenance and monitoring
- Built-in rate limiting and error handling

### Monitoring & Logging
**Choice: Sentry + DataDog + JSON Logging**
- Sentry for error tracking
- DataDog for metrics and monitoring
- Structured JSON logs for audit trail

Rationale:
- Comprehensive visibility into system health
- Detailed audit trails for compliance
- Easy log aggregation and analysis

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Sprint 0-1)
1. Set up Django project with:
   - Custom User model
   - Basic authentication
   - Database migrations
2. Initialize React frontend with:
   - React-Spreadsheet integration
   - React Query setup
3. Deploy basic Docker environment

### Phase 2: Budget Management (Sprint 2)
1. Implement budget CRUD operations
2. Set up versioning system
3. Create locking mechanism
4. Build spreadsheet interface

### Phase 3: Integration Layer (Sprint 3)
1. Configure Make.com for:
   - ClickUp connection
   - Google Sheets sync
2. Implement webhook handlers
3. Set up background tasks

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Analytics (Sprint 4-5)
1. Configure logging systems
2. Set up error tracking
3. Implement metrics collection
4. Create basic dashboards

## Outstanding Questions

### Technical Considerations
1. **Concurrency Handling**
   - How to handle concurrent Google Sheets edits?
   - What's the lock timeout duration?
   - How to manage conflict resolution?

2. **Data Migration**
   - Strategy for importing existing budgets?
   - How to handle historical data?
   - Version migration approach?

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache strategy for frequent queries?
   - Indexing strategy for large datasets?
   - Batch processing thresholds?

### Business Logic Questions
1. **Versioning Rules**
   - When should new versions be created?
   - How to handle version comparisons?
   - Version retention policy?

2. **Access Control**
   - Detailed permission requirements?
   - Client access limitations?
   - Audit requirements?

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - ClickUp API rate limits?
   - Google Sheets sync frequency?
   - Error handling preferences?
